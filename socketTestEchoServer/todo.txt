current goals
- add in the simulator type stuff
- first goal is to add in the grass layer but with forethought
    over how the rest of the program will work.
- add in the event system.
    - one of the events will be "planted" this will be how the
        grass spreads
    - the planted event should have a source, the position
        being planted and the type of things being planted.
        - the type of thing being planted will probably be
            just a layer.


-- i think that the basic event system necessary to make the grass layer works is done.
-- now i just need to make a function for drawing the grass layer and then hook up the main thing to continuously
  - ask the layers for their decisions and then handle the decisions.


-- goal is to make a way for the layers to handle global queries such as "does this address exist."
  - the layerManager is capable of handling this question, but there is no way for the layers
    to access  the layer manager right now.

-- also need to plan for how the layers will be passed a context.

-- may want to consider an event category of "attemptTo" events.
   - ex: an "attemptToPlant" would enforce whether the action is possible and then generate a planted event.
   - the planted event does not need to check whether the event is possible because it is assumed it must be possible.
   - this would also allow keeping the legality logic in the same class as the one generating the event.
   - The bunny ai may generate an "attempt to eat grass" but the bunny class would handle the "attemptToEat" event
     and verify whether or not the grass were actually there to eat.
     - actually this is an interesting case, becasue it shoudl probably be the grass checking whether or not it exists.
     - maybe like this.
        bunny handles attemptToEat, generating the ate event if it succeeds
            edge case: multiple bunnies attempt to eat the same grass. this is possible multiple eat events generated.
        grass handles the ate event and generates the digested event if it succeeds (the eat action actually takes energy not gives it)
            edge case: multiple eat targetting the same grass, only the first eat generates a digested event.
            - because of this we may have to scramble the eat events.
        bunny handles the digested event. ( the bunny handling this actually recieves energy).
