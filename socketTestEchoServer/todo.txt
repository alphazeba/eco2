current goals
- add in the simulator type stuff
- first goal is to add in the grass layer but with forethought
    over how the rest of the program will work.
- add in the event system.
    - one of the events will be "planted" this will be how the
        grass spreads
    - the planted event should have a source, the position
        being planted and the type of things being planted.
        - the type of thing being planted will probably be
            just a layer.


-- i think that the basic event system necessary to make the grass layer works is done.
-- now i just need to make a function for drawing the grass layer and then hook up the main thing to continuously
  - ask the layers for their decisions and then handle the decisions.
